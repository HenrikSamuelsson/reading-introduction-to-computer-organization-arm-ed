*ISA*&#x2003;instruction set architecture  

## Introduction

A computer is a machine that can solve problems, by executing a program in the form of a sequence of *machine instructions*, part of the machines *instruction set architecture (ISA)*.

Programs are generally implemented by a programmer using a human friendly high-level language, rather than working directly with the ISA.

### Who the Book is For

The book teaches low-level details about how computers work.

It is assumed that the reader knows how to program in a high-level language, and the book will focus on underlying low-level *assembly language*, that translates directly to machine instructions.

Writing in assembly is harder than writing in a high level program, the main high-level programming language used in the book is C.
